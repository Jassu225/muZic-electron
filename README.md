Basic electron-react-es6-webpackHMR boilerplate
===============================================

This is the boilerplate to work on **electron** with the latest **EcmaScript-2015** syntax and **React JS** framework. 

It works with **webpack** middleware to run a Hot Module Reload with an **express** server on localhost. It is entirely **development** ready.
